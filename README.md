## Recommendations

    This would help gather recent data, and have doctors follow their model of healthcare practice in house.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    This would require more bio technology to be used, and with their recent collabaoration with BioNTech it would be easier to have a supplier for the needs in the automated clinic.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? 
    Direct access to this tech would help develop precise healthcare practices for Tempus.
